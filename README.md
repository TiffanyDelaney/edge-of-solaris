Windows users: navigate to application.windows and download this folder then run the exe inside it

Linux users: navigate to application.linux and download this folder then run the binary inside it

Mac OS users: you will need to download the source and download Processing 4. open edge_of_solaris.pde in Processing and compile the program for Mac OS. I cannot compile one for you because it must be compiled from a Mac OS machine and I do not have one
