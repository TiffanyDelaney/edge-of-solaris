IMPORTANT: all commands that have an index input are two digit only (except from tint which is single digit), it is important you use for example 05 instead of 5.
-s indicates the start of a vn segment, these are scanned top to bottom and zero indexed, I put the index value next to the command but this is not necessary (such as -s 00)
For each dialogue section there are 3 inputs, in order of left to right it is left side vn portrait image, right side vn portrait image and tint. For the portraits: 0-9 are zerina, 10-19 are esence, 20-29 are cyana, 30-39 are veda, 99 is blank. For the tint: 0 is fade right side (left side talking) and 1 is fade left side (right side talking)
-c loads to any screen. the screen indexes are: 0 = game, 1 = title, 2 = level select, 3 = visual novel story stuff, 4 = settings menu, 5 = status, 6 = mess hall, 7 = hanger, 8 = engineering
-l loads any level, levels are 0 indexed and notable level 02 is the performance test level
