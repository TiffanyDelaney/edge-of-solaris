the war between the naturals and the modifieds happens inside the atmosphere, then after the war is finished there is a time skip and the mods have colonized space with space colonies on other planets and asteroids. 

the mods know that there are dissenters in the asteroids, so they send out mass probes to scan the area, you fight these probes when you travel from place to place or asteroid to asteroid.
