the war between the naturals and the modifieds happens inside the atmosphere, then after the war is finished there is a time skip and the mods have colonized space with space colonies on other planets and asteroids. 

the mods know that there are dissenters in the asteroids, so they send out mass probes to scan the area, you fight these probes when you travel from place to place or asteroid to asteroid.

the naturals are from the nation of Faun. the modifieds are from Aegis Alliance.

Zerina starts flying for aegis, but slowly begins to question what they are doing as they are forced to fly more and more questionable missions. Zerina is good friends with Cyana. Zerina ends up flying their ship into the rebel faction's area. Immediately after Zerina defects, as the only one on the ship with flight/assault skills, Cyana is sent after Zerina. Cyana finds Zerina but knows she can't shoot them down (either emotionally, practically or perhaps both). They have a moment on the coms where they talk about defecting, etc. Cyana decides to return back to the Oreillana and tell her superiors she did not find them. This won't be the only time they have to face each other in combat.
