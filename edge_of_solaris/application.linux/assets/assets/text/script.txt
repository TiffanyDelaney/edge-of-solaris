Esence: I heard back from engineering, your nebulon is finally operational Zerina. Good timing too, your first mission is set for 1400 hours.
Zerina: The Nova Wasp... Does this nebulon have enough power to finally end the war
Esence: Chill out, just focus on the mission. This will give us good data regardless of the outcome.
Esence: The mission today is to test your new nebulon, we found some stragglers, take them out.
-- 4 hours later --
Zerina: I'm taking off. It is time to see if the performance simulations of this nebulon are accurate.
Esence: For this mission your nebulon has been equipped with dual Gen 17 beam cannons.
Esence: Your secondaries are unguided missiles, they explode on impact.
Zerina: Nova Wasp MDN-49, launching
[level 0]
Esence: How do you like those beam cannons? They are multiple generations ahead of anything the naturals have.
Esence: I'm picking up a large cluster of enemy vessels in front of you, looks like like there's a bomber at the end of the fleet. Take it out.
Zerina: My nebulon...
Zerina: Nova Wasp launching
