Esence: I heard back from engineering, your nebulon is finally operational Zerina. Good timing too, your first mission is set for 1400 hours.
Zerina: The Nova Wasp... Does this nebulon have enough power to finally end the war with Faun?
Esence: Chill out, just focus on the mission. This will give us good data regardless of the outcome.
Esence: The mission today is to test your new nebulon, we found some natural stragglers, take them out.
-- 4 hours later --
Zerina: I'm taking off. It is time to see if the performance simulations of this nebulon are accurate.
Esence: For this mission your nebulon has been equipped with dual Gen 17 beam cannons.
Esence: Your secondaries are unguided missiles, they are more powerful than your beam cannons but harder to aim.
Zerina: Nova Wasp MDN-49, launching
[level 0]
Esence: How do you like those beam cannons? They are multiple generations ahead of anything the naturals have.
Esence: I'm picking up a large cluster of Faun vessels in front of you, looks like like there's a bomber at the end of the fleet. Take it out.
Zerina: My nebulon...
Zerina: Nova Wasp launching
[level 1]
Zerina: What power. With this nebulon, I can finally bring victory to the Aegis Alliance.
Esence: Is that why you joined the Aegis Airforce?
Zerina: I didn't join. I am a designer baby created specifically to pilot this nebulon.
Esence: That explains it, the acceleration on this nebu is insane. I don't know anyone else who could pilot such a machine without passing out.
Esence: Lets go back to the Oreillana.
- Back at the Oreillana -
Cyana: Welcome back
