00 10 1 Esence: I heard back from engineering, your nebulon is finally operational Zerina. Good timing too, your first mission is set for 1400 hours.
00 10 0 Zerina: The Nova Wasp... Does this nebulon have enough power to finally end the war with Faun?
00 11 1 Esence: Chill out, just focus on the mission. This will give us good data regardless of the outcome.
00 10 0 Esence: The mission today is to test your new nebulon, we found some natural stragglers, take them out.

01 10 0 Zerina: I'm taking off. It is time to see if the performance simulations of this nebulon are accurate.
00 11 1 Esence: For this mission your nebulon has been equipped with dual Gen 17 beam cannons.
00 10 1 Esence: Your secondaries are unguided rockets, they are more powerful than your beam cannons but harder to aim.
01 99 0 Zerina: Nova Wasp MDN-49, launching

00 10 1 Esence: How do you like those beam cannons? They are multiple generations ahead of anything the naturals have.
00 13 1 Esence: I'm picking up a large cluster of Faun vessels in front of you, looks like like there's a bomber at the end of the fleet. Take it out.
01 99 0 Zerina: My nebulon...

00 11 0 Zerina: What power. With this nebulon, I can finally bring victory to the Aegis Alliance.
00 12 1 Esence: Is that why you joined the Aegis Airforce?
01 11 0 Zerina: I didn't join. I am a designer baby created specifically to pilot this nebulon.
00 10 1 Esence: That explains it, the acceleration on this nebu is insane. I don't know anyone else who could pilot such a machine without passing out.
00 10 1 Esence: Lets go back to the Oreillana.
99 99 0 - Back at the Oreillana -
00 21 1 Cyana: How did the mission go?
01 20 0 Zerina: It went well, all thanks to your training
00 22 1 Cyana: Uh I think it was mostly due to the new ship and its pilot.
00 20 0 Zerina: This nebulon, this is probably the most technologically advanced ship ever made
00 10 1 Esence: It really is something isn't it. None of the Faun craft even have shield systems.
00 11 1 Esence: This war will be over before you know it
00 10 0 Zerina: I certainly hope so. The sooner the bloodshed ends the better.
00 12 1 Esence: Why are you always so serious? Go talk to Veda in engineering she has a new weapon for you.
01 30 0 Zerina: Hey Veda, what have you been working on?
00 32 1 Veda: Oh, hey Zeri! I have a a sweet new weapon for you. Its a machine gun.
00 33 1 Veda: The rate of fire is insane but the accuracy kinda sucks. You can switch weapons with the number keys.
